#String Compression
##Functional Description
This is a command-line application developed in C to compress and decompress text files using the Run-Length Encoding (RLE) algorithm.
##Features
**Compression Mode**:

. Reads an input text file specified by the user.
. Compresses the content by replacing sequences of repeating characters with the character followed by the count.
. Writes the compressed data to an output file.
**Decompression Mode**:

. Reads a compressed file generated by the program.
. Decompresses the content to reconstruct the original text.
. Writes the decompressed data to an output file.
##Solution Description
###Run-Length Encoding (RLE) Algorithm
**Compression**:
Repeated characters in the input are replaced by <character><count>.
Example: aaaabbc becomes a4b2c1.
**Decompression**: The compressed format is expanded back to the original string.
Example: a4b2c1 becomes aaaabbc.
##Complexity Analysis
**Compression**:

**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the size of the input file. Each character is processed once.
**Space Complexity**: O(1) additional space is required for processing, assuming output is written directly to the file.
**Decompression**:

**Time Complexity**: O(m), where m is the size of the compressed file. Each encoded segment is processed once.
**Space Complexity**: O(1) additional space is used for decompression, assuming output is written directly to the file.
##Optimality Justification
The Run-Length Encoding (RLE) algorithm is an efficient approach for compressing data with repeated characters, especially for text with many long sequences of identical characters. Its simplicity and linear performance make it optimal for small-scale applications like this tool.
##Instructions for Cloning and Running the Project
###Prerequisites
A C compiler (e.g., GCC).
Basic knowledge of command-line operations.
###Steps to Clone the Project
1. Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-compression-tool.git
2.Navigate to the project directory:
bash
cd simple-compression-tool
###Build and Run the Program
1.Compile the program:

bash
gcc -o compression_tool compression_tool.c
2.Run in Compression Mode:
bash
./compression_tool -c input.txt output.rle
-c: Specifies compression mode.
input.txt: Input file to be compressed.
output.rle: Output file where compressed data will be stored.
3.Run in Decompression Mode:

bash
./compression_tool -d output.rle decompressed.txt
-d: Specifies decompression mode.
output.rle: Compressed file to be decompressed.
decompressed.txt: Output file with the decompressed content.
###Example
1.Input (input.txt):

aaaabbc
2.Compressed Output (output.rle):
a4b2c1
3.Decompressed Output (decompressed.txt):
aaaabbc
###Testing
You can add your test cases in tests/ directory (if applicable) and use the following command to run tests:

bash
./run_tests.sh
